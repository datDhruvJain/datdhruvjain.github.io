A person I met once said that you may be able to do a task in your favorite language in 1 min, and in some other language in probably 10 minutes. However the task is still that of programming, and how you approach the problem still stays the same.

Every expert I met keeps saying the same thing.

So, let us focus on practicing programming rather than practicing a language.

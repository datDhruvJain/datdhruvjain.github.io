## In case you mess up document templates

#### Rename the Global Template File
1. Close Word and any other Microsoft Office programs you are running.

2. Right-click the Windows “Start” button and select "Open Windows Explorer."

3. Browse to “C:\Users(your username)\AppData\ Roaming\Microsoft\Templates.” Sometimes you can’t see the AppData file since it is hidden. You can type the full path into your Explorer address window and press Enter to go to the Templates subdirectory.

4. Right-click on the "Normal.dot" file and choose "Rename." Type in a name like "OldNormal.dot" or "Normalold.dot."

5. Open Word. The program will recreate the Normal.dot file based on its default settings.

## For MacOS and multiple accounts

You can have multiple Microsoft accounts on your office apps, but you **need** the one which is the licensing account to be **on** the device. From there on you can *add* new accounts by adding *onedrive* storage. (click on account icon --> add connected service, it will be the one under onedrive)

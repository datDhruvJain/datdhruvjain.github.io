Further, if you’re looking for Python project ideas for final year, this list should get you going. So, without further ado, let’s jump straight into some Python project ideas that will strengthen your base and allow you to climb up the ladder. 

You can also enrol yourself for Free Python Certification Course.
1. Mad Libs Generator
One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on python projects for students is working on Mad Libs Generator. This is the perfect project for beginners who are just starting out with software development. Primarily focused on strings, variables, and concatenation, this project will teach you how to manipulate user-inputted data. The program design is such that it will ask users to enter a series of inputs that will be considered as a Mad Lib. Mab lib is one of the python projects for beginners.

The input could be anything, an adjective, a noun, a pronoun, etc. Once all the inputs are entered, the application will take the data and arrange the inputs into a story template form. Sound fun, right?

2. Number Guessing
This is one of the simple python projects yet an exciting one. You can even call it a mini-game. Make a program in which the computer randomly chooses a number between 1 to 10, 1 to 100, or any range. Then give users a hint to guess the number. Every time the user guesses wrong, he gets another clue, and his score gets reduced. The clue can be multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.



You will also need functions to compare the inputted number with the guessed number, to compute the difference between the two, and to check whether an actual number was inputted or not in this python project.

3. Text-based Adventure Game
This is a basic version of the Adventure game. It is completely text-based. In this version of the game, users can move about through different rooms within a single setting, and based on the user input, it will provide descriptions for each room. This is one of the interesting python projects. 



Movement direction is crucial here – you must create walls and set the directions in which the users can move through the rooms, set movement restrictions, and also include a tracker that can track how far a user has walked or moved in the game. Mentioning Python projects can help your resume look much more interesting than others.

4. Dice Rolling Simulator


As the name of the program suggests, we will be imitating a rolling dice. This is one of the interesting python projects and will generate a random number each dice the program runs, and the users can use the dice repeatedly for as long as he wants. When the user rolls the dice, the program will generate a random number between 1 and 6 (as on a standard dice).

The number will then be displayed to the user. It will also ask users if they would like to roll the dice again. The program should also include a function that can randomly grab a number within 1 to 6 and print it. This beginner-level python projects will help build a strong foundation for fundamental programming concepts.

5. Hangman
This is more of a “guess the word” game. The core concepts you have to use while developing this project are variables, random, integer, strings, char, input and output, and boolean. In the game, users have to enter letter guesses, and each user will have a limited number of guesses (a counter variable is needed for limiting the guesses). This is one of the interesting python projects to begin with. 

You can create a pre-organized list of words that users can grab words from. Also, you must include specific functions to check whether or not a user has entered a single letter or if the input letter is in the hidden word, to if the user has actually inputted a single letter, and to print the correct outcomes (letters).

6. Contact Book


This is one of the excellent python projects for beginners. Everyone uses a contact book to save contact details, including name, address, phone number, and even email address. This is a command-line project where you will design a contact book application that users can use to save and find contact details. The application should also allow users to update contact information, delete contacts, and list saved contacts. The SQLite database is the ideal platform for saving contacts. To handle a project with Python for beginners can be helpful to build your career with a good start.

7. Email Slicer
This is one of the convenient python projects that has a lot of use in the future. The program helps get you the username and domain name from an email address. You can even customize the application and send a message to the host with this information.

8. Binary search algorithm
Have you ever heard the proverb, “finding a needle in a haystack.” This program is designed to do just that- by using a binary search algorithm. You can create a list of random numbers between 0 to 100, with every succeeding number having a difference of 2 between them.



When the user inputs a random number, the program will check if that number is included in the list. It will do so by creating two halves of the list. If the program finds the number in the first half of the list, it will eliminate the other half and vice versa. The search will continue until the program finds the number input of the user or until the subarray size becomes 0 (this means that the number is not in the list). This python project idea will help you create an implement an algorithm that searches for an element in a list. 

9. Desktop Notifier App
Have you ever wondered how notifications work? This small python project idea will throw some light on this. The desktop notifier apps run on your system and send you a piece of information after a fixed interval of time. We suggest you use libraries such as notify2, requests, etc. to build such a program.

10. Python Story Generator


This is a fun but exciting python project which will work wonders with kids. In a nutshell, the program will ask users for inputs such as the name of a place, action, etc. and then build a story around the data. The story will be the same always but with little variation with the input.

11. YouTube video downloader


One of the best ideas to start experimenting with you hands-on python projects for students is working on a YouTube video downloader. More than a billion people watch YouTube every month. Sometimes there are videos we like to download permanently. YouTube doesn’t give you that option, but you can create an app with a simple UI and the ability to download YouTube videos in different formats and video quality. This project looks tough, but it is straightforward when you start working on it.

12. Python Website Blocker


When we surf the internet, many unwanted websites keep showing up. This is one of the useful python projects where you can build a program that blocks certain websites from opening. This program is beneficial for students who want to study without any social media distractions. Mentioning python project can help your resume look much more interesting than others.

13. Spin a Yarn
Things get more interesting here since strings are infinitely more complex to play with at the beginning.

The program first prompts the user to enter a series of inputs. These can be an adjective, a preposition, a proper noun, etc. Once all the inputs are in place, they are placed in a premade story template using concatenation. In the end, the full story is printed out to read some misintended madness!

14. What’s the word?
This name focuses on the user having to guess the randomly generated word. You can create a list from which the word would have to be guessed and also set a cap on the number of guesses allowed.

After this, you can create the rules yourself! When the user inputs the word, you can indicate whether the alphabet written appears in this particular position or not. You will need a function to check if the user is inputting alphabets or numbers and to display error messages appropriately.

15. Rock, Paper, Scissors
If you are tired of having no playmate, then a 5-minute stint of rock, paper, scissors with the computer and designed by you, yourself will improve your mood.

We again use the random function here. You make a move first and then the program makes one. To indicate the move, you can either use a single alphabet or input an entire string. A function will have to be set up to check the validity of the move.



Using another function, the winner of that round is decided. You can then either give an option of playing again or decide a pre-determined number of moves in advance. A scorekeeping function will also have to be created which will return the winner at the end.

16. Leap it!
In this python project, you input a year and check whether it is a leap year or not. For this, you’ll have to create a function that recognizes the pattern of leap years and can try fitting the inputted year into the pattern. In the end, you can print the result using a boolean expression.

17. Find out, Fibonacci!
You input a number and the function created checks whether the number belongs to the Fibonacci sequence or not. The underlying workings are similar to the above ‘Leap it!’ program.

One common theme in all the above projects is that they will help you to get your basics right. You will be the developer and the bug fixer. Not to mention, you’ll be closing working with creating and implementing a variety of functions along with working with variables, strings, integers, operators, etc. Just like 2 + 2 is the building block of your mathematics knowledge, so are these concepts, and learning about them in a fun way through building projects will help to understand and retain them more.

These are some of the most straightforward Python project ideas for you to work on. Once you finish these, let’s move to the next level.

24. Alarm Clock


This is one of the interesting python project ideas. People all across the globe use alarm clock applications. It is quite a simple Command Line Interface (CLI) Python application for an intermediate-level developer. However, this project isn’t your run-of-the-mill alarm clock. In this application, you can input YouTube links in a text file and design the application to read the file. If you set a particular time in the alarm clock, it will pick a random YouTube link from the text file and play the YouTube video.

25. Tic-Tac-Toe
We all have fond memories of playing Tic-Tac-Toe with our friends in school, don’t we? It is one of the most fun games you can play anywhere – all you need is a pen and paper! Usually, two players can play Tic-Tac-Toe at a time. The players create a 3×3 square grid. This is one of the coolest python project ideas. 

While the first player puts “X” in any one of the squares, and the second player will put an “O” in any square. This process will continue until all the squares are filled with each player putting X and O alternatively. The player who succeeds in creating a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal with three consecutive X or O on the grid wins.

You can use the Pygame library for building this project. Pygame is loaded with all the modules you need for computer graphics and sound.

26. Steganography
Steganography is the art of hiding a secret message in another form of media, for example, hiding a coded message in an image or video. You can create a program that protects messages inside pictures for you.

27. Currency converter


This is a simple GUI application that you can develop using Python. As you can guess by the name, you will build a currency converter that can convert currencies from one unit to another, for example, converting Indian rupee into pound or euro.

The design of this application will be straightforward – the main focus should be the primary function, that is, converting currency units from one to another. You can use Tkinter, the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped along with Python.

28. Post-it Notes
Post-it notes are an excellent way to note down trivial chores so that you don’t forget to do them. In this project, we’ll make a virtual version of the physical, adhesive post-it notes. The main goal of building this application is to allow users to carry their post-it notes wherever they go (since it is on a digital platform).

The application should have an option for account creation, different layouts for post-it notes, and a categorization feature to allow users to segment their notes. You can consider using Django for this project since it has an in-built user authentication feature.

29. Site Connectivity Checker
The job of a site connectivity checker is to visit a URL and display the status of that URL, that is, whether or not it is a live URL. Usually, site connectivity checkers visit URLs at regular intervals and return the results each time. This project will work on the same lines – it will check the live status of URLs. Site connectivity checker is one of the interesting python projects for beginners.

You must design the code for this application from scratch. As for your connections, you can either opt for TCP or ICMP. You can use click, docopt, or argparse frameworks for adding commands that will enable users to add and delete URLs from the list of URLs they want to check. 

30. Directory Tree Generator
A Directory Tree Generator lets you visualize the relationship between files and directories, thereby making it easier to understand the positioning of files and directories. For this project, you can use os library to list the files and directories within a specific directory. Again, docopt or argparse frameworks are excellent tools for the project.

Python Project Ideas: Advanced Level
31. Speed Typing Test


Let’s start advanced python project ideas for beginners. Do you remember the old typing test game which was used in Windows XP and before? You can create a similar program that tests your typing speed. First, you need to create a UI using a library like Tkinter. Then create a fun typing test that displays the user speed, accuracy, and words per minute in the end. You can also find source code for the program online.

32. Content Aggregator
The internet is filled with websites, articles, and information. When we want to find something, it is tough to go through each of them. For this use, you can create a content aggregator that automatically searches popular websites and looks for relevant content and then complies with all the content and lets the user choose which content they want. It is very much like Google but unbiased. And this is the perfect idea for your next python project!

33. Bulk File Rename/ Image Resize Application
This is an advanced project which needs you to be well-versed in Machine Learning. We will begin by teaching the program on how to pre-process data, then perform a few resize and rename images tasks. As the program starts learning, it can handle bulk functions at once.

34. Python File Explorer
This is a significant project as it will test your knowledge on the various concepts of Python. You need to build an app that anyone uses to explore the files in their system. You can also add features like searching and copy-paste. Tkinter is a commendable choice for this project as it makes the development of GUI applications fast and easy.

To create the Python File Explorer using Tkinter, you have to import the filedialog module from Tkinter. This module is designed for opening files and directories and saving them.

35. Plagiarism Checker
Content writing is one of the most prolific online businesses. The market lacks a free tool that can be used to check for plagiarism in documents. You can use a natural language processing library along with the Google search API to create a program that searches the first few pages of Google and checks for plagiarism.

36. Web Crawler
A web crawler is an automated program script that surfs the internet and stores the content of a particular webpage. A web crawler is one of the most useful python projects to find up-to-date information. You will need to use a multi-thread concept for such a program. You can use Python’s request module to make the crawler bot, or you can use Scrapy. It is Python’s open-source web crawling framework explicitly designed for web scraping and extracting data by using APIs.

37. Music Player
Everyone likes listening to music; you can also create your music player app. Other than playing music, your program can explore your file directories and search for music. This is one of the creative python projects you might face is creating an interactive interface that can be used by regular users.

The app will have a neat interface that will allow users to browse through tracks, increase/decrease volume, display the name of the song, artist, album. This project will mainly involve the basics of Python programming, database management, algorithm construction, and data processing

38. Price Comparison Extension
This can be an interesting and useful python project idea. Just like Trivago, you can create a program that searches a few notable websites for the price of a product and then show you the best deal. It is a convenient program, as many businesses started on this small program. You can use this extension for groceries, stationery, etc.

39. Expense Tracker
As you can guess by the name, an expense tracker is a software application that lets you keep track of your expenses, and even analyze the expenses. In this python project, you will build a simple expense tracker that can keep track of the user’s expenses.

Expense tracker is one of the trending python projects which should also be able to perform statistical analysis to give accurate insights to users on their expenses so that they can plan their expenses better. You can use PySimpleGUI to create the interface for this application, and even Python libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib can be handy tools for the project.

40. Regex Query Tool
Regular search tools often fail to produce the desired results for specific queries. In such events, what you need is a Regex Query Tool. In simple words, a regex is a set of strings, which means that when you enter a query in this tool, it will check the validity of your query.

If the regex can match patterns in the text query entered by the user, it notifies the user by highlighting all the matching patterns. A Regex Query Tool is one of the trending python projects which allows users to quickly check the validity of their regex strings on the Web, thereby making the search process much easier. Python’s re library is the perfect tool for running the query strings on the user-inputted text.

41. Instagram Photo Downloader


This would be an app that automatically downloads all the Instagram images of your friends. As Instagram is growing everyday, this is one of the useful python projects and it is quite similar to the above command line app as this app will use your credentials to open your account and then look for your friend’s ID and download their photos. This app would be handy when people want to delete pages and save just the images.

42. Quiz Application
This is one of the interesting python project ideas to create. This is a standard quiz application that presents a set of carefully curated questions to the users (a questionnaire), allows them to answer the same, and displays the correct answer if they are wrong. Each test will display the final score of the user. The application will have an account creation option, wherein some users can be appointed as Admins.

These Admins can create tests for other users. In this way, the tests and quizzes continue to be updated. This application requires a database to store all the questions, answers, and scores of the users. You can also include additional features like timers for tests.

Which Project Platform Should You Choose?
You may wonder which project platform should you select for your python projects. It is essential to develop your software projects on a specific platform so that others (particularly those lacking technical expertise) can also use your product. There are three main platforms that developers use to build python projects – Web, desktop, and command-line.

Web
Web applications are software projects that can run on the Web. Anyone with a working internet connection can access web applications on any device – you don’t need to download them separately. Thus, if you want to make a software product for public use, the Web is the ideal platform for such applications. 

Web applications are elaborate projects having both back-end and front-end. While the back-end refers to the business logic of your application that manipulates and stores the data, the front-end refers to the user interface of your application – the part that users can see and interact with. Keeping back-end as the focus of your web application, you must also learn the basics of front-end development with tools like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 

However, if you work with Python, it can take care of all your back-end and front-end development needs. Python has an exclusive library that eliminates the need for using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS – Anvil. Apart from this, there are many other Python-based web frameworks like Django, Flask, Web2Py, CherryPy, and Pylons, to name a few. 

Desktop GUI
Since desktop applications are widely used by people across the globe, building a desktop application is a great project idea for both freshers and intermediate-level Python developers. The best part about developing desktop GUIs (Graphical User Interface) is that you need not learn any front-end technology. Python is all you will need for creating desktop applications.

Python comes with several frameworks for building desktop applications. While PySimpleGUI is a user-friendly Python framework, PyQt5 is one of the advanced Python-based GUI frameworks. 


Once you develop a desktop GUI, you can even make it compatible with all the three major operating systems (Linux, Windows, or macOS) by compiling it into executable code for the OS you wish to run it on. 

Command-Line
Command-Line Applications are those applications/programs where user interaction is entirely dependent on the terminal and shell. These applications function in a console window. As such, they are devoid of any form of graphics and visual interface for the users to see. Thus, to use command-line applications, you have to enter specific commands – while users can enter their input (commands) using ASCII characters, the app will also provide the output through ASCII. This is one of the most popular python projects in recent times. 

Naturally, command-line applications demand a certain level of technical know-how of commands. Although they aren’t as user-friendly as web or desktop applications, common-line applications are robust and powerful. Python has a range of useful command-line frameworks, including click, docopt, Plac, Cliff, and Python Fire.

Python Project Ideas: Conclusion
In this article, we have covered 42 Python project ideas. We started with some beginner projects which you can solve with ease. Once you finish with these simple python projects, I suggest you go back, learn a few more concepts and then try the intermediate projects. When you feel confident, you can then tackle the advanced projects. If you wish to improve your python skills, you need to get your hands on these Python project ideas. Now go ahead and put to test all the knowledge that you’ve gathered through our python project ideas guide to build your very own python project!

You can continue to add new features in the system as and when user requirements change.

5. e-Healthcare management system


One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on Java projects for students is working on e-Healthcare management system. The e-Healthcare management system is a web-based project that seeks to provide effective management of employee data and medical data of patients in hospitals and clinics.

Data mining techniques lies at the core of this project, which consists of 2 modules: an administration module and a client module. While the administration module is concerned with Medicare Management that includes healthcare departments, doctors, nurses, ward, and clerks, the client module is for patients.In many ways business intelligence is revolutionizing healthcare.

- It eliminates the problems of missing data and incorrect data. 

Through these features, the e-Healthcare management system will help overcome the drawbacks and challenges of the existing healthcare management system. It will allow for the smooth management of hospital staff and quicken the process of delivery of healthcare services.

6. Email client software
So, why not use your skills to develop an impressive java project based on email system? This project is an email program designed for sending and receiving electronic mail. In the project, you will use the standard sockets and networking along with Java Mail API. There are two main protocols used in the project – SMTP and POP3. This is one of the java projects for beginners. 

Usually, conventional email client software conducts electronic mailing through web browsers like Hotmail, Yahoo, Google, etc. Since these systems use HTTP port 80 to access all the emails, it is not precisely the best means to send sensitive or confidential messages. Hackers can easily hack into the software system and violate or misuse the data.

The project functions something like this – the ISP’s (Internet Service Provider) mail server handles the emails sent from an ISP. All the sent emails first come to the mail server, after which they are processed and forwarded to the collector’s destination where another mail server is located.

The mail server on the collector side receives the incoming emails and sorts them electronically in the inbox. Now, the recipient can use their email application to view the received emails. The entire transaction occurs by directly connecting to the mail server through the program, which makes it much safer than the existing email client software.


7. Library management system


This software project is implemented in Java using MS Access database design. It is designed for managing and maintaining libraries in any educational institution through an integrated computerized system. The library management software will allow librarians to operate more productively while handling the typical day-to-day tasks of a library. 

In a traditional library management system, everything is done manually. All the library operations and records, including the number of books, genres of books, names of books, records of the students who’ve issued/returned books, etc., are all done via pen and paper. Naturally, this process requires a significant amount of time, effort, and even human resources. If you are looking for final year java projects, this is perfect for you.  

The proposed project seeks to solve all the challenges associated with the traditional library management system. Since it stores and manages all the library records in a computerized database, it eliminates the need for manual record-keeping. The software includes different modules, each of which handles and manages specific library operations. Mentioning Java projects can help your resume look much more interesting than others.

By using this software application, librarians and students need not search the entire library to find a book. They can enter the name and author of the book, and the system will display the list of all the possible books available for that search keyword/phrase. This is one of the best features of this library management software.

8. Network packet sniffer
A network packet sniffer is a packet analyzer software used for monitoring network traffic. It is a web-based Java application that facilitates web-based monitoring of network packets traveling across the system network. By using this software application, the Admin can capture network packets and analyze the data received and sent from/to the network. The software helps capture the source of the network packets and the destination address.

The main objective of this project is to establish a set of rules during runtime to prevent hackers from attacking the system software with viruses and malware. Unlike standard network hosts that only track the traffic sent exclusively to them, this software application captures each packet, decodes it for analysis as the data streams flow across a network. Some of the most commendable features of this software application are:

- 24×7 network monitoring
- Real-time packet capturing
- Advanced protocol analyzing
- Complex network analyzing
- Automatic packet-level analysis
- Comprehensive packet decoding

9. Online bank management system
This is one of the interesting Java projects to create. This project focuses on developing an online banking system. The main aim is to create an online banking platform that is accessible from any location, so customers need not go to the bank branches for routine banking operations like money withdrawal, money transfer, balance inquiry, etc. 

Visiting the physical branches of banks is not only time consuming but can also be hectic, thanks to long queues and waiting time. Not to forget, running to banks for every minor banking task creates an unnecessary burden on bank staff. These issues can be addressed by developing an online banking system that will offer seamless and prompt banking services to customers. However, to use this software application, a user must be registered with the system. To do so, the user has to create a unique user name and password for securely logging in to the application.

This online bank management application will provide the following services to customers:

- Customers can view their account details such as type of account, available balance, the interest rate on available loans, credit/debit statements, etc. from any remote location.
- Customers can check their transaction history that includes necessary information like transaction time, type, and amount.
- It will display the amount of deposited cash or withdrawn cash along with the date of deposition/withdrawal.

10. Online medical management system
This is another web-based Java project that is designed to create a direct line of communication between doctors and patients. The project is known as “Virtual Medicine Home.” By using this application, patients can book online appointments with their preferred doctors, and doctors can offer healthcare suggestions, e-prescription, and view the patient’s medical records, lab reports, etc. The application also lets users look for and connect with blood and eye donors. This is one of the excellent java project ideas for the current time. 

In conventional healthcare service systems, all medical management operations are manual. The problem is more pronounced in remote and rural areas that lack proper medical infrastructure, qualified healthcare professionals, and sophisticated medical equipment. This is one of the java projects for beginners. Furthermore, there are no provisions for recording and storing medical data. This online medical management system can help bridge all these problems by linking doctors and patients directly. 

The application has two modules — an Admin module and a Doctor module. The Admin module manages the online software system, and the Doctor module allows doctors to interact with patients. Anyone can access the services provided by this app from any location via the Internet. 


11. Online quiz management system
One of the best ideas to start experimenting you hands-on Java projects for students is working on online quiz management. This Java-based application proposes to create an online discussion platform that will consist of a wide range of questions on different topics, fields, and subjects. By creating a user-friendly environment of Bluebook implementation, this application is a resourceful tool for individuals who wish to practice mock quizzes and tests. Online quiz management system is one of the interesting java projects. 

In this project, you will build a comprehensive online platform for managing both quiz competitions and the participants in the different teams. This application can be used by academic institutions and any organization willing to find suitable candidates through the process of quizzing. 

The application permits multiple admins, each having their unique user id and password. While admins can create an “n” number of participating teams for a quiz, they can also set an “n” number of rounds for the quiz. All the participants will automatically receive the questions, and the teams will have to answer within an allotted time.

In case a team is unable to answer a question or gives the wrong answer, they’ll receive negative marking. The teams having the lowest average score will be eliminated, and the remaining teams will continue to compete in the next level. This will continue until the winner is declared. The scores for each team will be automatically updated. And this is the perfect idea for your next Java project!

12. Online Survey System
This is a project for developing an online survey system using Java as the foundation. The focus of the project is to build an online platform that can efficiently collect the viewpoints of the target audience of a survey via the Internet. This application can launch online surveys and also send email notifications. Any organization in any industry can use this application to conduct online surveys for obtaining necessary information from their target audience groups. 

In this survey application, only the users authenticated by the Admin can cast their vote and express their opinion on a particular issue or topic. Once the users submit the votes, the software will collect this using the ratio button or checkbox. It will then automatically add the votes to each alternative and display the result after the deadline of the survey.

The main features of this online survey system project include:

It is coded in Java with MySQL server database.
It can hide the identity of users/voters, thereby collecting all the information in confidentiality.
It collects the votes using the ratio button or checkbox.
It can be installed anywhere at an affordable cost.
Since the survey is conducted online, it eliminates several hours of manual labor, along with a significant reduction in survey costs. 

13. RSS feed reader
The goal of the RSS feed reader project is to minimize the delay between the publication of new content on the web and its appearance on the reader/aggregator. It allows the retrieval of the latest content posted on a website quickly on the aggregator, thus, making the content readily accessible to the users for reading. The RSS feed reader management system is equipped with improved content monitoring policies for all RSS feeds. 

The existing aggregator management applications use the homogeneous Poisson model that relies on a specific data source (either a webpage or RSS feed). As a result, these applications cannot adapt if the data source changes. They do not even have well-designed monitoring policies. This project incorporates and implements new content monitoring strategies to overcome the drawbacks of the existing aggregator management applications. The new RSS feed reader leverages a non-homogeneous Poisson model and delay matrices.

This RSS feed reader management system investigates the techniques used by RSS aggregation services to monitor web content and to retrieve the data promptly using minimal resources, to enable readers to access the content without delay. The project focuses mainly on the server-based aggregation scenario.

The proposed model has the following functional requirements:

It should be able to provide information from disparate data sources to all users.
The system should be able to run efficiently using minimal system resources.
The time delay must be minimized so that users can view the data quickly on their feed.
The aggregated content should be converted into a document format compatible with browsers.
The RSS content must be monitored at frequent intervals.
14. Smart city project
The Smart City project is a web-based software application built to store all the essential details of a city. Cities and urban areas witness a massive wave of people coming from every corner in search of jobs, education, and even a better lifestyle. In the initial days after the move, people don’t know the main facilities, attractions, and services offered in the city. The smart city project seeks to address that by creating an integrated platform to store essential and related information to guide the newcomers in a city.

The application will provide visitors, students, and job seekers information like hotels, renting facilities, transportation services, healthcare services, airline ticket booking, shopping landmarks, emergency helpline, and basically every information that one needs when in a new city. It is like a smart city guide for visitors.

Users can connect to the application via the Internet and browse all the smart city web pages to get the details they need. Users can see the entire map of a city along with the important landmarks. This will make their movement across the city much more comfortable. Mentioning java projects can help your resume look much more interesting than others.

The smart city application has five modules:

Administration module – It is the central controller of the application. It uploads all the new information on the site and authenticates user profiles, and supervises the maintenance of the other four modules.
Tourism module – As the name suggests, this module handles all the tourism-related operations in the city, such as hotels, restaurants, tourist attractions, ATMs, theatres, and so on. A user authenticated by the administration module becomes the primary user of this module.
Student module – This module is designed specifically for helping students move around the city. It contains all the academia related information for students, including the location of best educational institutes, libraries, coaching centers, technical colleges, universities, colleges, etc.
Jobseekers module – This module contains important information on the job opportunities available in the city. Users can access all kinds of job-related information across various industries. The main objective of this module is to help the city administration to combat unemployment problems in the city.
Business module – This module focuses on offering business-related news, information, and opportunities in the city. Users can access information on trade and business centers and industries in the city.

16. Supply chain management system
This is one of the interesting Java projects. Supply chain management refers to the management of businesses interconnected over a network. It includes a whole range of management procedures like handling, storage, and movement of raw materials, inventory, and transporting finished goods from the source to its final destination.

This project aims to smoothen the supply chain management process by closely monitoring the dealers and clients and continually tracking the products through the different points in the supply chain. Using this application, a company can directly communicate with its clients, obtain the product requirements, manufacture the product to fit those requirements, and finally ship it off to the client. 

This project uses JSP, JDBC, and HTML for the front-end and MS Access as the back-end database. It is a web-based application that will automate the system of communication between the management or admin, dealers, and clients of the company. There are three modules in this application:

Admin module – The Admin uses this module to check information on the manufactured products, newly launched products, and products that must be delivered to the clients.
 Dealer module – This module keeps track of all the essential information concerning the dealers, particularly the record of items. Dealers can generate and update the item list for a product using this module. 
Client module – The client uses this module to provide the necessary specifications of a product. The client feedback is processed through this module and forwarded to the Admin. 
By using this application, the clients can directly convey their product requirements to the manufacturer, who then contacts multiple vendors to acquire the necessary resources for making the product. The dealers usually create a list of items as per the product information provided to them, after which the manufacturer selects the materials that best fit the specifications given by the client.

Then, the selected list of items is forwarded to the inventory department for processing, after which the manufacturing begins. Once the production is complete, the accounts department calculates the raw materials’ costs and manufacturing costs to generate the total bill. Finally, the product, along with the invoice, is shipped to the client. The client is free to offer feedback on the received product.

17. Virtual private network


VPN is one of the trending java projects. This goal of building this virtual private network (VPN) is to extend a private network across a public domain (for example, the Internet). A VPN is created by setting up a point-to-point virtual connection via traffic encryption, dedicated connections, or virtual tunneling protocols.


There are three interconnected modules in this VPN project: 

Administration module – This module monitors all the office operations and manages the staff details. 
Marketing module – This module handles everything related to the marketing operations of the software application.
Training module – This module manages all the technical operations like software testing, networking, call center, and J2EE training.
Confidentiality, authentication, and data integrity are the three core elements of this VPN security model. The other pivotal features of this application are:

It allows for the addition of new clients, a feature better known as “scalability.” This feature allows a company/organization to accommodate new clients in the network as it expands. 
It uses a remote backup server to prevent the system from failing due to sudden crashes. Since a VPN handles a large volume of files that are created every day, it is crucial to have a remote backup server to process all the requests coming from the client to the server and vice-versa.
It uses a remote monitoring system to keep track of the activities of every client or individual connected to the VPN. This ensures that the privacy and security of the network remain intact.
As is true of all VPNs, this VPN application, too, has the provision for certification in the system. When two or more LAN (Local Area Network) systems interact, certification is mandatory to protect the system’s security. 
It triggers and sends acknowledgement signals to notify clients on successful data transfer (whether or not the data has successfully reached the desired destination).

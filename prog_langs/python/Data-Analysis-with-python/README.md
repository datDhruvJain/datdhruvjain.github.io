## What is data analysis?
A process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modelling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision making.

## Steps involved in Data Analysis:

1. Data Extraction. This step invovles actually getting the data. Data can come from various sources and various types of sources like files, databases, CSV, XML, JSON, APIs etc.

2. Data Cleaning. Data may not be "in shape" in which case you need to clean the data to make sure that your algorithm can actully work with the data, and does not crash. This, for example, includes dealing with NaN values. 

3. Data Wrangling. This involves *Reshaping* and transforming the data and indexing it for quicker access. We may also choose to merge data entries and join the data. Objective of this step is to get the data ready for the next step.

4. Analysis. This involves extracting patterns from the data capturing trends, or anamolies. Involves building statistical models, visualizations and representations, correlations vs causationa analysis, hypthesis testing, statistical analysis and Reporting.

5. Action. Finally we do something with the analysed data, for eg creating machine learning models etc.
